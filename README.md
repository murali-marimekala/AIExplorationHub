## 🚀 Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup or the automated script doesn't work:

### 1. Clone and Navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/murali-marimekala/AIExplorationHub.git
cd AIExplorationHub
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ai_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source ai_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
ai_env\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Platform
```bash
# Start Jupyter Lab (in another terminal)
source ai_env/bin/activate  # Activate environment first
jupyter lab --no-browser --port=8888
```

### 4. Open Your Learning Platform
- **Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000
- **Jupyter Lab**: http://localhost:8888

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ "jupyter: command not found"
**Cause**: Jupyter is not installed or virtual environment not activated

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Option 1: Use automated setup
./quick_start.sh  # macOS/Linux
# OR
quick_start.bat   # Windows

# Option 2: Manual fix
source ai_env/bin/activate  # Activate environment
pip install jupyter jupyterlab

# Option 3: System-wide install (macOS with Homebrew)
brew install jupyter
```

#### ❌ "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'"
**Cause**: Required packages not installed in the active environment

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source ai_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# OR
ai_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individual packages
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy plotly ipywidgets
```

#### ❌ "externally-managed-environment" error
**Cause**: System Python is protected (common on macOS/Linux)

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Always use virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv ai_env
source ai_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use --user flag (not recommended)
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# macOS users can use Homebrew
brew install jupyter
```

#### ❌ Jupyter Lab won't start or exits immediately
**Cause**: Port conflict, permission issues, or corrupted installation

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Try different port
jupyter lab --port=8889

# Clear Jupyter cache
jupyter lab clean

# Reinstall Jupyter
pip uninstall jupyter jupyterlab
pip install jupyter jupyterlab

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :8888  # See what's using port 8888
```

#### ❌ Visualizations not showing in notebooks
**Cause**: Widget extensions not installed or enabled

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install widget extension
pip install ipywidgets
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

# For older Jupyter Lab versions
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

# Restart Jupyter Lab after installation
```

#### ❌ Web dashboard not loading (localhost:8000)
**Cause**: HTTP server not running or port conflict

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Start HTTP server manually
python -m http.server 8000

# Try different port if 8000 is busy
python -m http.server 8001

# Alternative servers
npx serve .  # If you have Node.js
php -S localhost:8000  # If you have PHP
```

#### ❌ Permission denied errors
**Cause**: Insufficient permissions to create files/directories

**Solutions**:
```bash
# macOS/Linux - fix permissions
chmod +x quick_start.sh

# Windows - run as administrator
# Right-click Command Prompt → "Run as Administrator"

# Use user directory for virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/ai_env
source ~/ai_env/bin/activate
```

#### ❌ Git clone fails
**Cause**: Network issues or authentication problems

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use HTTPS instead of SSH
git clone https://github.com/murali-marimekala/AIExplorationHub.git

# Or download ZIP file
# Go to GitHub repo → Click "Code" → "Download ZIP"
```
